# ft_printf()

## Reproduce the classic printf function! (partially)

### First contact with VARIADIC FUNCTIONS

## The rules
 
### Mandatory part:
* Don’t implement the buffer management of the original printf()
* Handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
* Use the command 'ar' to create your library (libtool is forbidden)
* libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository
### Bonus part:
* Manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.’ and the field minimum width under all conversions. 
* Manage all the following flags: ’# +’ (Yes, one of them is a space) ✅
## Learning Expirience

* Got to know about variadic function and how to use them
* I implemented this in a simple way, withouth any dynamic memory management. Because of this i could not handle the firts part of the bonus
* Increased understanding about string manipulation
